# Examples
## Json parser:
A parser which can read json files, see [Examples/src/main/kotlin/json](Examples/src/main/kotlin/json).  
This example relies completely on Klex for the structure of the output, and converts it to its own format `JsonElement<T>`.  
This example shows how Klex can be used to parse json, but this parser is not intended for use in serious projects, it is merely an example.
